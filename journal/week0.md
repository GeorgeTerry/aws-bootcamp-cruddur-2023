# Week 0 — Billing and Architecture

## 02/13/2023  
  - Today I expended some time reviewing the first 3 videos in the student portal. The video about the security of the account was handy. I never used before AWS Organization for my personal accounts. Of course, I used AWS Organizations, Control Tower, and SSO in the company account but not for my personal projects. 
  - I  sent an invite to my account from a centralized account, which was very interesting for me. I need to check the budget for my projects but I think I can enable some SCP for my accounts. 
  - I am checking the Lucid Chart video from Andrew. I think tomorrow morning I will create both diagrams.

- Today a worked on the Cruddur Logical Diagram. I understand the application flow. 
- I never used Lucidchart before. Seems like a good tool for my future projects. I used to use Microsoft Visio, but Lucidchart is really great. Thank you for that.
